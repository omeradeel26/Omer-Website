                This game of checkers was coded in Python and created with the GUI tool Processing. The skills required to
                build this project include a knowledge of loops used to predict open spots, knowledge of 
                variables to control different factors of the game such as player turn or the number of checkers left and knowledge of 
                UI to create different features such as a homescreen, gamescreen, instruction screen, and endgame screen.

               This project was really helpful for developing my experience with GUI's. I learned different techniques such as creating different screens
               , buttons the players can use or how to interact with the mouse. Furthemore, I was challenged quite a bit with creating the jumping mechanism
               in checkers because in order to create the feature the program must predict all the open spots a checker can jump to. My solution to this problem
               was creating a convoluted while loop that did work, however with little bugs. Reflecting on the project, I wish I had created the jumping feature
               with a recurisve algorithim. All in all, this project was fun to make and really challenged me to hone in on my Python programming skills.

                This program allows a user to play a randomly generated game of Sudoku and includes a solver as well if the user would like to use it.
                Using a function that loops through an array with the Randomy Py module, the game randomly generates a Sudoku board for the user to play with. 
                The function will call the solver function to make sure that the game is fully solveable for the user. The user when playing with the board can
                select a number to place into the empty spaces and if the number is not valid then the user will get a mistake which appears in the bottom left corner. 
                The solver function is created using a recursive algorithim called backtracking. If the user wants to solve the game, they press the spacebar and the board will become solved and the game will end. The game was created with 
                the GUI python module PyGame.</div>

                I did not really have any challenges with this project other than the time commitment to creating it. I learned three new things with PyGame, backtracking
                and Objected Oriented. I was slightly familiar with OOP before, but after this project it gave me a good idea on how classes and methods work.
                In addition, I learned the backtracking algorithim which gave me the biggest challenge just trying to figure out how exactly the function would recurse and
                change numbers, but definetly was a great learning experience. Lastly, I learned PyGame which is a GUI library, it was okay to use but just required a learning curve.

                Backend is designed using Flask (micro web framework written in Python). In the backend, the program calls on the weather station API to receive data on future forecasts (Temperature, Precipitation, Solar Radiation). The data is then applied to a uniquely designed algorithm that calculates the amount of water (in liters) that is required to fill the plant’s water capacity to 100%. The algorithm adjusts the output depending on the number of hours it has been since the user has last watered the plant. The Algorithm uses Hargreaves Model: ET0 = 0.0135 (Temperature + 17.78) * Solar Radiation/day. Conversions are required for specific units but the algorithm collects Temperature (degrees Celsius), Precipitation (mm/meter^2), and Solar Radiation (MegaWatts/sec). Once the backend completes its calculations, Flask sends this information to the front-end. Front-end is designed in HTML/CSS with many hours spent on color, formatting, text, etc. Front-end also includes a welcome page and applies the algorithm for specific plants.

            <div class="modal__description">
               <b>Using Flask:</b> Flask was a challenging language to use in terms of its tedious installation process and importing the proper files. After 2-3 hours we finally got it to work where we used API code for getting data from the weather station.
                <br><b>Algorithm:</b> The algorithm was difficult to compose because of the many different units. The API returned values that were in completely different units than what the algorithm required. To solve this, we wrote in conversion factors in our code to properly calculate the algorithm (Took 2 hours).
                <br> <b>Calling Isolated Data from the API:</b> In order to improve the program, our initial plan was to calculate the hourly rate that water is evaporating/transpiring from the plant. However, upon further experimentation of the data from the API, we had trouble taking the specific temperature for each hour because of the bad organization of the list that the API returned. To solve this, we calculated the average amount of water leaving the plant rather than the hourly rate (Took 5-6 hours).
                <br> <b>HTML/CSS Working:</b> As most of us were beginners, we had almost no experience with HTML and CSS in terms of coding. After learning the language, we worked to improve the display to tailor it to our liking (Took 16-18 hours)

                Validdit shows the user useful information about a Reddit post, such as the upvote/downvote ratio, info/history about the poster, comments with links to other news articles, and comments that contain keywords that may question or help verify the validity of the post.
                In terms of how it was built, HTML, CSS, and JS were used to build the frontend. Python was used to build the backend, working in tandem with the Frame web framework to communicate with the frontend. PRAW, also known as the Python Reddit API Wrapper, was used to access the Reddit API and receive public information from the site, such as a post's information and comments.

                Before creating this project using PRAW, we started it with JRAW (java reddit api wrapper). We realized that working with JAVA and implementing the API was much more difficult. 
                We had to try using MAVEN which no one was experienced with and try messing with JSON files. We switched to Flask which eased up process signifigantly. The hardest part was creating 
                the keyword checker, which checked for controverial keywords located in the reddit page and displayed them. All in all, the project was a good experience for web app development with Python
                and was a lot of fun to make.

                The project I decided to build with the Arduino Mega MC was a basic calculator. The calculator can compute a 5 digit number with the operators: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The project includes a button for starting up and closing down the LCD screen and calculator program. Once the button is pressed, a buzzer sounds off to indicate the screen has turned on, and vice-versa when the screen turns off. The buzzer also sounds off when pressing down the ‘clear’ or ‘equals’ button. A potentiometer is also attached to the LCD, which controls the contrast of the display. The user can make calculations using previously made calculations by just pressing down an operation button with the old one on the screen.

                Creating the calculator really challenged my ability to code in C. I learned different skills such as iterating lists, storing items as variables and also using C in the Arduino IDE. 
                Along with the code, I had to setup all the hardware and physically connect all the components to the breadboard and different pin outs on the Arduino. The project was one of my first
                projects created with the Arduino kitset, beforehand I only created Arduino simulated projects using Tinkercad.

                Accesso is a student-run non-profit focused on tackling 
                wheelchair inaccessibility in the GTA.
                The website provides in-depth reviews on how wheelchair accessible malls 
                and stores are across Toronto. As Chief Technology Officer
                my responsibility is to lead the team responsible for managing and updating the website,
                an integral facet of the organization. Also, my other tasks involve the management of any IT related activites, such as our YouTube channel.

                PRVD is a website that allows users to seamlessly view donation opportunities nearby. Our
                API filters through different donation drives and presents the user with options that are
                convenient. The platform allows charities to gain more exposure for their initiatives with a
                more targeted approach than a social media ad campaign. Through our item logging system,
                charities can keep track of the items they have received from donations. Once a user donates
                an item, it is automatically logged into a list that contains all the donated items. This allows the
                charity to simply confirm donations instead of having to enter it into a separate system
                themselve
