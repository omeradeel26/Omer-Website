The project used a variety of different data types such as lists, dictionaries and tuples. This also has a heavily reliance upon the python processing graphics.",
            lesson: "I learned to create a full functioning game in python processing. It taught me to merge graphics, use basic data-types, and different game ideas such as an infinite loop. However, there are many things I would like to improve on from this project such as creating re-usable code, using recursion for game mechanics and implementing object-oriented programming.",

Additionally, this project helped me apply my skills in using the random import in python, object-oriented concepts and use advanced concepts such as inheritance. I hope to expand this project with the use of A.I.",
